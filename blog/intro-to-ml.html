    <blockquote>
      <p>In 1956, a group of scientists gathered at Dartmouth College with a bold claim:<br>
      they would spend the summer teaching a machine to think like a human.<br><br>
      Seventy years later, a machine looked at a photo of your retina and spotted a tumor<br>
      a human doctor would have missed for another six months.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <h2>01 — The Problem With Traditional Programming</h2>
    <p>Imagine you want to write a program that detects spam emails. In traditional programming, you sit down and write rules: <em>if the email contains "FREE MONEY" → mark as spam. If it contains "claim your prize" → spam. If it comes from a Nigerian prince → definitely spam.</em></p>
    <p>This works. For a while. Then spammers adapt. They write "FR33 M0N3Y." They use different languages. They disguise the sender. You write more rules. They adapt again. You're in an arms race you can't win — because the world is too complex and too unpredictable to be captured in hand-written rules.</p>
    <p><strong>Traditional programming</strong> is: <em>Data + Rules → Answers</em>. You write the logic. The computer executes it.</p>
    <p><strong>Machine learning flips this completely:</strong> <em>Data + Answers → Rules</em>. You show the machine thousands of spam and non-spam emails, tell it which is which, and it <em>figures out the rules itself</em>. Rules you never would have thought to write.</p>

    <div class="prose-callout gold">
      <span class="prose-callout-label">🏫 Analogy</span>
      <p>Teaching a child the difference between dogs and cats. You don't hand them a rulebook: "four legs, fur, meows = cat." You just show them pictures. Hundreds of them. Dog. Cat. Cat. Dog. Dog. After enough examples, they just <em>know</em>. They've built an internal model from patterns — even if they can't explain the rules they learned.</p>
      <p style="margin-top:0.75rem">That is exactly what machine learning does. The "child" is the algorithm. The "pictures" are your training data. The "internal model" is the trained ML model.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>02 — A Precise Definition</h2>
    <p>The classic definition comes from Arthur Samuel (1959): <em>"Machine learning is the field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed."</em></p>
    <p>Tom Mitchell gave a more precise version (1997): <em>"A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some task T and performance measure P, if its performance at task T, as measured by P, improves with experience E."</em></p>
    <p>In plain language: an ML model gets <strong>better at a task</strong> the more <strong>data</strong> it sees. That improvement is measurable. That's it.</p>

    <h2>03 — The Four Families of Machine Learning</h2>
    <p>All of ML breaks into four broad families depending on what kind of data you have and what you're trying to do:</p>

    <div class="prose-steps">
      <div class="prose-step">
        <div class="prose-step-num">1</div>
        <div class="prose-step-text">
          <strong>Supervised Learning — learning with a teacher.</strong>
          You have labeled examples: inputs paired with correct answers. Spam/not-spam. Cat/dog. House price given its size and location. The model learns the mapping from input → output.
          <br><br>
          <em>Real-world examples:</em> Email spam filters, disease diagnosis from X-rays, house price prediction, credit card fraud detection, voice recognition.
          <br><br>
          This is the most common type of ML today and the focus of the first half of this series.
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="prose-step">
        <div class="prose-step-num">2</div>
        <div class="prose-step-text">
          <strong>Unsupervised Learning — learning without a teacher.</strong>
          You have data but no labels. No correct answers. The model has to find structure on its own — grouping similar things together, finding hidden patterns, compressing information.
          <br><br>
          <em>Real-world examples:</em> Customer segmentation (grouping shoppers by behavior), anomaly detection (spotting unusual transactions), dimensionality reduction (compressing data while keeping meaning), topic modeling in documents.
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="prose-step">
        <div class="prose-step-num">3</div>
        <div class="prose-step-text">
          <strong>Semi-Supervised Learning — learning with a little help.</strong>
          A practical middle ground. You have a small amount of labeled data and a large amount of unlabeled data. The model uses both. This is extremely common in medicine — getting expert labels is expensive, but getting raw scans is cheap.
          <br><br>
          <em>Real-world examples:</em> Medical image analysis (a few hundred labeled scans + thousands of unlabeled ones), web content classification, speech recognition.
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="prose-step">
        <div class="prose-step-num">4</div>
        <div class="prose-step-text">
          <strong>Reinforcement Learning — learning from consequences.</strong>
          There are no labels, no pre-packaged answers. Instead, an <em>agent</em> takes actions inside an environment, receives a reward or penalty based on the outcome, and gradually learns a strategy (called a <em>policy</em>) that maximises cumulative reward. Think of it as training a dog — you don't hand it a rulebook, you reward the good behaviour and let it figure out the rest.
          <br><br>
          This family of ML is uniquely suited to sequential decision-making: situations where the right action now depends on what will happen later.
          <br><br>
          <em>Real-world examples:</em> AlphaGo and AlphaZero (board games), robotic arm control, autonomous vehicle navigation, real-time bidding in ad systems, training large language models with human feedback (RLHF — the technique behind ChatGPT's conversational quality).
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="prose-kv"><div class="prose-kv-key">Supervised</div><div class="prose-kv-val">Labeled data. Input → Output mapping.</div></div>
      <div class="prose-kv"><div class="prose-kv-key">Unsupervised</div><div class="prose-kv-val">No labels. Find hidden structure.</div></div>
      <div class="prose-kv"><div class="prose-kv-key">Semi-supervised</div><div class="prose-kv-val">Some labels + lots of unlabeled data.</div></div>
      <div class="prose-kv"><div class="prose-kv-key">Reinforcement</div><div class="prose-kv-val">Agent + environment + reward. Learn by doing.</div></div>
    </div>

    <h2>04 — Where Does Deep Learning Fit?</h2>
    <p>You've heard "AI," "Machine Learning," and "Deep Learning" used interchangeably. They're not the same thing. Think of them as nested circles:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Artificial Intelligence (AI)</strong> is the broadest idea — any technique that makes machines seem intelligent. Chess engines, expert systems, and calculators are all AI in some sense.</li>
      <li><strong>Machine Learning</strong> is a <em>subset</em> of AI — specifically, systems that learn from data instead of following hand-coded rules.</li>
      <li><strong>Deep Learning</strong> is a <em>subset</em> of ML — specifically, ML that uses very large neural networks with many layers. The "deep" refers to the depth (number of layers) in the network.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Deep Learning is what powers GPT-4, image recognition in your phone, AlphaFold's protein predictions, and Mohamed's Qwen 2.5 VLM for retinal analysis. It's incredibly powerful — but it requires far more data and compute than classical ML. For many real-world problems, simpler ML methods (Random Forests, XGBoost) still outperform deep learning.</p>

    <div class="prose-callout accent">
      <span class="prose-callout-label">🔗 Connection to Modern AI</span>
      <p>ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude — these are all examples of supervised + unsupervised learning at a massive scale. They were trained on trillions of words (data) with human feedback (labels). The core idea is exactly what you just learned: show the system enough examples, and it builds an internal model that generalizes. The scale is different. The principle is identical.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>05 — What ML Cannot Do</h2>
    <p>Understanding limits is as important as understanding capabilities. ML models:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Don't understand.</strong> They find statistical patterns. A model that classifies lung cancer from X-rays has no concept of lungs, cancer, or health. It recognizes patterns in pixels that correlate with radiologist labels.</li>
      <li><strong>Don't generalize beyond their training data.</strong> A model trained on data from 2020 may fail on 2024 data if the world changed. This is called <em>distribution shift</em>.</li>
      <li><strong>Require data.</strong> Lots of it, ideally. A model trained on 50 examples of a rare disease will not be reliable.</li>
      <li><strong>Are only as good as their labels.</strong> Garbage in, garbage out. Biased labels produce biased models — one of the most serious problems in applied AI.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>06 — A Thought to Sit With</h2>
    <div class="prose-callout">
      <span class="prose-callout-label">💬 For You to Consider</span>
      <p>Traditional programming is transparent — you can read every rule. Machine learning models are often a black box — even their creators can't fully explain why they made a specific prediction.</p>
      <p style="margin-top:0.75rem"><strong>If a model recommends denying someone a bank loan, and no one can explain why — is that acceptable?</strong> Where does accuracy end and accountability begin?</p>
    </div>

    <h2>07 — Coming Up Next</h2>
    <p>Tomorrow — <strong>Day 2: The ML Pipeline.</strong> We walk through the complete journey a real ML project takes: from raw, messy data to a deployed model. Data collection, cleaning, feature engineering, training, evaluation, and deployment. This is the skeleton every ML engineer works inside.</p>

      <span class="prose-callout-label">🎯 Interview Questions</span>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>What is the difference between AI, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning?</strong><br>
        <em>AI is the broadest field — any technique making machines appear intelligent. ML is a subset where machines learn from data rather than explicit rules. Deep Learning is a subset of ML using large multi-layer neural networks.</em></li>
        <li><strong>What is the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning?</strong><br>
        <em>Supervised learning uses labeled data (input-output pairs) to learn a mapping function. Unsupervised learning finds hidden patterns or structure in unlabeled data.</em></li>
        <li><strong>How does machine learning differ from traditional programming?</strong><br>
        <em>Traditional programming takes data and rules to produce answers. ML takes data and answers to produce rules — the model learns the logic instead of being explicitly programmed with it.</em></li>
        <li><strong>What is a training set and why do we need one?</strong><br>
        <em>A training set is the data used to fit the model's parameters. The model learns statistical patterns from it. Without training data, the model has no experience to generalize from.</em></li>
        <li><strong>Can you name a real-world application of each type of ML?</strong><br>
        <em>Supervised: email spam detection. Unsupervised: customer segmentation. Semi-supervised: medical image analysis with limited labeled scans. Reinforcement: AlphaGo, robotics control.</em></li>
      </ol>
