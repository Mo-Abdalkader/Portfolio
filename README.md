## What's here

A static site that houses two things: a project showcase and a blog focused on making AI and machine learning genuinely understandable — not just technically accurate, but clear enough that someone encountering these ideas for the first time actually walks away with them.

The blog is currently running a **30-Day AI Ramadan Series** — one concept per day, explained from the ground up with analogies, working code, and honest intuition before formalism.

## Direction

The guiding principle behind everything here is that complexity should be earned. Most AI content either oversimplifies to the point of being useless, or assumes prior knowledge that most readers don't have. The goal is to find the middle path — rigorous enough to be correct, human enough to land.

## Stack

Pure HTML · CSS · Vanilla JS — deliberately kept simple so the content stays the focus.
